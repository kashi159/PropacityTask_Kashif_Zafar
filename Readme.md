Hey Everyone, This is a very minimal version of a File Manager Application.
Sorry for the Frontend, its minimalistic at best.

To run this code please follow the following steps:- 

1. Fork and download the repo.
2. Open the repo folder in your code editor.
3. Open the terminal and direct to the desired folder.
4. Run npm install.
5. create .env file.
6. You will also need to configure the database username and password and AWS credentials in the .env file.
7. rum npm start.
8. Open the pubilc folder to see the front end part. 
9. click on Login.html/Signup.html and open with live server or open directly in browser.
10. And Now you can either Register or Login as per your Requirements.
11. Since you are now logged in you can now create folders or create sub-folders or upload files to the folder and rename, move or delete files.
11. Enjoy!!!
